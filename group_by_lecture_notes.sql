# GROUP BY LECTURE

# The "GROUP BY" clause is used to aggregate a table into various groups of shared characteristics.
#
# Grouping data is often accompanied with the use of aggregate functions to derive additional information
# about the various groupings.
#
# Most common aggregate functions are:
#
#     MIN()
#     MAX()
#     SUM()
#     AVG()
#     COUNT()
#
# One or multiple columns may be grouped together.
#
# No table columns may exist in a SELECT clause that are not contained in the GROUP BY clause.
#
#     The GROUP BY clause is after an optional where clause and before an optional order by clause.
#
#     The order of a result set may be by an aggregate column but an aggregate column cannot be referenced in a where clause.
#
# A having clause is a way to use aggregate results as if in a where clause.

# --------- Grouping by a single column

# What are the titles?
SELECT *
FROM titles;

# What are the unique titles?
SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM titles;

# What are the groups of like titles?
SELECT title
FROM titles
GROUP BY title;

# How many employees have held each title?
SELECT title, COUNT(*)
FROM titles
GROUP BY title;

# What gender are all the employees?
SELECT gender
FROM employees; # all genders of all employees listed

# How many unique genders are recorded in this company?
SELECT DISTINCT gender
FROM employees; # all distinct genders in company

# What the groups created for each gender?
SELECT gender
FROM employees # creating groups of employees by gender
GROUP BY gender;

# How many employees are within each gender designation?
SELECT gender, COUNT(*)
FROM employees # how many are in each gender group?
GROUP BY gender;

# How many people share the same hire date?
SELECT hire_date, COUNT(*) AS `No of Employees Hired`
FROM employees
GROUP BY hire_date
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

select MIN(salary) from salaries;

# How many salaries are at a given amount?
SELECT salary, COUNT(*)
FROM salaries
GROUP BY salary
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;


# --------- Grouping by multiple columns

# How many employees share the same birthday?
SELECT birth_date, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY birth_date
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;


# How many male and female employees share the same birthday?
SELECT gender, birth_date, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY gender, birth_date
ORDER BY birth_date;


# COUNT function

# Find total number of employees
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employees;

# Find how many employees share the same name

# 1 Find the most common name

SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY first_name, last_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
